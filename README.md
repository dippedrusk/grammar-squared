# Grammar-Squared

## Why?

I want a simple system to read a left-recursive context-free grammar, and convert it into an OpenFst-compatible FST without having to write any code.
Also I've wanted to write another compiler for forever.

## What's in a name?

This project is likely going to be in Antlr and Java. I'll have to write a grammar to parse a user-provided grammar and build an FST. Ergo, grammar squared.
